During my elementary years, I went to the following schools: W.J. Langlois, 
Christ the King, and St. Gabriel. I graduated from St.Gabriel in 2015 and I 
then moved on to pursue my high school experience at Holy Names Catholic 
High School. I enjoyed taking math courses and science courses. On the other 
hand, I throughly disliked taking the mandatory English courses since English 
is my least favourite and weakest subject. Moreover, now I am studying at the 
University of Windsor and I am taking the following courses: Differential 
Calculus, Linear Algebra, Programming and Algorithms, Introduction to the 
Internet, and Key Concepts in Computer Science. University is truly a big 
change compared to high school, but I am prepared to adapt to these new conditions.

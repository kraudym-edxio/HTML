<pre style="font-family:verdana; text-align:right;">
One of my main hobbies/interests is playing video games. I enjoy gaming
because I find it entertaining and stimulting to the mind. I am interested
in RPG style, adventure, and action based games. I've developed a liking
for video games ever since I was a little kid, which is why this hobby is
so important to me. Aside from gaming, I also enjoy spending time with
friends and family. Moreover, I make plans with my freinds at least once a 
week since I am availiable to do so and I enjoy taking a break from work
and school once in awhile.

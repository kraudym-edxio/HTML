A few months ago, I was able to obtain my first part time job. I work at Antonino's
Original Pizza (South Windsor) and I enjoy my job. Relative to other part
time positions availiable to students, I think that this is a great job considering
I work in a positive environment and my co-workers are all respectable individuals. 
In addition to this, I only work on the weekends since I am busy with school Monday
to Friday. Working only on weekends allows me to maintain school as my number one 
priority and dedicate the necessary amount of time to study and succeed.
